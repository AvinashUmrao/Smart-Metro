## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîÑ Compile & Run

Ensure you have a C++ compiler (`g++`) installed.

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-metro.git
   cd smart-metro/admin_user
   ```

2. Compile and run:

   * **User/Admin dashboard:**

     ```bash
     g++ metro.cpp -o metro
     ./metro
     ```
   * **Route Finder (only):**

     ```bash
     g++ project.cpp -o project
     ./project
     ```

> External files (`map.txt`, `home.txt`, `exit.txt`) are used for display purposes, make sure they're in the same directory.
