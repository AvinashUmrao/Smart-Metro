/*
Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array ranks representing the ranks of some mechanics. ranks[i] is the rank of the ith mechanic. A mechanic with a rank r can repair n trains in r * nÂ² minutes.
You are also given an integer trains representing the total number of trains waiting in the garage to be repaired.
Return the minimum time taken to repair all the trains.
Note: All the mechanics can repair the trains simultaneously.



Example 1:
Enter the number of mechanics: 4
Enter the ranks of the mechanics: 4 2 3 1
Enter the total number of trains: 10
//1-> least time , 2-> more time 3-> more then 2nd one similarly 4-> more then 3rd one 


Input: ranks = [4, 2, 3, 1]    trains = 10

Output:16

Explanation:
The first mechanic will repair two trains. The time required is 4 * 2 * 2 = 16 minutes.
The second mechanic will repair two trains. The time required is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 minutes.
The third mechanic will repair two trains. The time required is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 minutes.
The fourth mechanic will repair four trains. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
It can be proved that the trains cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.
