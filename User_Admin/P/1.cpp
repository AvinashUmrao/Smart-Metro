Problem Title: Maximizing Metro Profit - Fractional Knapsack Problem (Greedy Approach)

Problem Statement:
------------------
You are in charge of a particular sector in the metro logistics system, responsible for 
sending goods from one location to another. You are provided with a transport bag that 
has a fixed weight capacity.

Each good has a specific weight and associated profit. Your task is to choose which goods 
to carry in the bag such that the **total profit is maximized**, keeping in mind that you 
can carry **fractions of goods** if needed.

Objective:
Maximize the total profit carried in the bag using a greedy method.

Approach:
---------
1. Calculate the profit-to-weight ratio for each good.
2. Sort the goods in decreasing order of this ratio.
3. Pick goods fully if possible.
4. If a good cannot be picked completely due to limited remaining capacity, take a fraction of it.

Example:
--------
Enter the number of goods: 3
Enter the capacity of the transport bag: 50
Enter the profit and weight of each good (profit weight):
Good 1: 100 20
Good 2: 60 10
Good 3: 120 30
Do you want to allow goods to be divided into fractions? (y/n): n
The maximum profit that can be obtained is: 160.00


Option "y" (Allow fractions): 
- Solves the fractional knapsack problem. 
- Goods can be divided into fractions to maximize profit. 
- The solution takes parts of goods if the remaining capacity doesn't fit the whole item, resulting in higher profit.

Option "n" (No fractions): 
- Solves the 0/1 knapsack problem. 
- You can only take whole goods. If an item can't fit entirely, it is excluded from the selection. 
- This results in a lower profit as compared to allowing fractions.
