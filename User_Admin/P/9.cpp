Problem Statement:
Optimizing Train Schedules (Flow of Trains)
To optimize train schedules in a metro system, we can represent the system as a directed graph. In this graph:

Nodes represent stations.

Edges represent rail lines connecting two stations, with each edge having a capacity, which indicates the maximum number of trains that can travel along that rail line in a given period (e.g., per hour).

The goal is to determine the maximum number of trains that can flow from a source station (e.g., a central terminal or starting station) to a sink station (e.g., the terminal or endpoint of the metro line), considering the limitations imposed by the capacity of each rail line (edge).

By using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, particularly its BFS-based implementation (Edmonds-Karp), we can find the maximum flow from the source to the sink. This will help us optimize the scheduling of trains, ensuring that the system operates at maximum efficiency without exceeding any stationâ€™s capacity or any rail line's ability to accommodate trains.
